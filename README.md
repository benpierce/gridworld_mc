## Gridworld with Monte Carlo on-policy first-visit MC control (for epsilon-greedy policies)

### Overview

This is my implementation of an on-policy first-visit MC control for epsilon-greedy policies, which is taken from page 1 of the book *Reinforcement Learning* by *Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto*

The algorithm in the book is as follows:

### Hyperparameters

### Convergence

### Q-States
